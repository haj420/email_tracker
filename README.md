# email_tracker

Description:  The email tracking system (name to change) is a simple PHP application that tracks emails using a MySQL database and a small image added to the end of the email message. When loaded, the email sends a request to the remote address of the image, triggering a function that updates the information stored in the database for that email.  All emails are tracked individually by a random code generated.
